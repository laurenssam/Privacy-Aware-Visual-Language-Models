title: "Privacy-Aware Visual Language Models"
description: "We explore how Visual Language Models (VLMs) manage privacy-sensitive content, an essential challenge as these models become more prevalent in daily applications. To address this, we introduce a novel benchmark, PrivBench, which includes images across eight sensitive categories, such as passports and fingerprints. Evaluating ten state-of-the-art VLMs using this benchmark, we find that their understanding of privacy considerations is generally limited, revealing a critical gap for improvement. In response, we present PrivTune, a new instruction-tuning dataset aimed at enhancing VLMs' awareness of visual privacy. Fine-tuning a pretrained VLM on this compact dataset leads to significant improvements in recognizing sensitive content, even surpassing GPT-4 in performance. Notably, this targeted tuning has minimal impact on standard tasks like VQA, demonstrating the feasibility of developing privacy-aware VLMs without sacrificing overall capability."
